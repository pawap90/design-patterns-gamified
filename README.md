# Welcome to **Design patterns gamified**! 

I created this repo to teach design patterns through games. Each folder contains a tiny game that demonstrates how to apply a single design pattern. 

Each folder also includes their own `README` with a short explanation of the design pattern and how it was applied in the game.

## Games

- [Strategy pattern - A space shooter ðŸš€](./strategy-pattern-space-shooter/): Destroy asteroids before they destroy you by picking up upgrades for your spaceship's gun. Each upgrade represents a new strategy that your ship can set at runtime!
