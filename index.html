<h1>Welcome to <strong>Design patterns gamified</strong>!</h1>
<p>I created this repo to teach design patterns through games. Each folder contains a tiny game that demonstrates how to apply a single design pattern. </p>
<p>Each folder also includes their own <code>README</code> with a short explanation of the design pattern and how it was applied in the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./strategy-pattern-space-shooter/">Strategy pattern - A space shooter</a>: Destroy asteroids before they destroy you by picking up upgrades for your spaceship's gun. Each upgrade represents a new strategy that your ship can set at runtime!</li>
</ul>
